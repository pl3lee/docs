# Teriyaki Salmon
## Ingredients
- 1 salmon fillet
- 1 clove garlic minced
- 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
- 2 tbsp water
- 1-1.5 tablespoons brown sugar depending on how sweet you like it
- 0.5 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
- 0.5 teaspoon sesame oil
- Optional: 0.5 teaspoon cornstarch + 0.5 tablespoon water 
## Instructions
<Steps>
### Step 1
Add garlic, soy sauce, water, brown sugar, rice wine vinegar and sesame oil to a medium bowl.
### Step 2
Add the marinade to a ziplock bag. Place salmon filets in the ziplock bag and marinate for 30 minutes.
### Step 3
Transfer salmon to prepared baking sheet (keep the marinade). Bake at 400 for 12-16 min or until salmon is flaky and cooked through, bake times may vary by thickness of salmon.
### Step 4
While salmon is baking, transfer remaining marinade to a small sauce pan and bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened (3-4 min) then remove from heat. (add cornstarch/water mixture if not thick enough)
### Step 5
Once salmon is out of the oven, brush with teriyaki syrup, then sprinkle with chopped green onion and sesame seeds as desired.
