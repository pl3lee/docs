# Mashed Potatoes

## Ingredients
- 4 medium sized potatoes
- 1 large garlic clove
- 2 slices of butter
- 1/3 cups of milk

## Instructions
<Steps>
### Step 1
Peel potatoes and cut into evenly sized pieces, place in pot of cold water (water should reach about an inch above the potatoes)
### Step 2
Stir garlic and 1 / 2 tbsp of salt into the water. 
### Step 3
Turn the heat to high and cook until the water comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high (or whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) and continue cooking for about 10-12 minutes, or until a fork inserted in the middle of a potato goes in easily with almost no resistance. 
### Step 4
As potatoes are boiling, heat the butter, milk and 1 tsp of sea salt into a pan until the butter is just melted (donâ€™t boil the milk)
### Step 5
After the potatoes are done boiling, carefully drain out all of the water.
### Step 6
After draining the water, place the pot back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to low.  Shake it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining steam within the potatoes. 
### Step 7
Remove the pot entirely from the heat and set it on a flat, heat proof surface.
### Step 8
Mash the potatoes to desired consistency. 
### Step 9
Pour half of the melted butter mixture over the potatoes, and fold it in with a wooden spoon or spatula until potatoes have soaked up the liquid. 
### Step 10
Repeat with the remaining butter, folding in each addition until just combined to avoid over-mixing.
