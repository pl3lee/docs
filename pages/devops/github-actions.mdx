# GitHub Actions
Notes taken from [this](https://youtu.be/R8_veQiYBjI?si=SGEjlC0J5xk0XLp0) video.
## What is GitHub Actions
It is a platform to automate developer workflows, and CI/CD is one of the many worksflows. Workflows can include reviewing pull requests, running tests, preparing release notes etc. These are all organizational tasks that could take a lot of time, so automating them is a good idea.
## How GitHub Actions automate these workflows
When something happens IN or TO your repository (GitHub Events), automatic actions are executed in response.

Some examples of GitHub Events are:
- Push to a branch
- Pull request created
- Issue created
- Contributor joined
- etc.

[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#about-events-that-trigger-workflows) is a list of the events that trigger a workflow.

So the flow of GitHub Actions is:
<Steps>
### Step 1: Listen to Event
For example, an issue is created.
### Step 2: Trigger Workflow
A workflow is triggered to sort, label, and assign the issue to someone. And each of these steps are separate actions. A chain of actions then make up a workflow.
</Steps>
## CI/CD with GitHub Actions
This is the most common workflow for your repository, it could consist of:
- Running tests
- Building the project image
- Pushing the image to a registry
- Deploying the image to a server

To start with a workflow, we can use a template from the GitHub Actions website, or we can create a new file in the `.github/workflows` directory of our repository. Let's look at a sample workflow file:
```yaml
# the name of the workflow, this is optional
name: CI/CD

# describes the events that trigger the workflow, this is also optional
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# one or more jobs, this is required
jobs:
# the name of the job, this can be arbitrary
# a job groups a set of actions that will be executed
  build_and_push:
    # the type of runner that the job will run on, can choose to run on ubuntu, windows, or macos
    # ubuntu has docker preinstalled, so we do not have to install docker
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    # under path actions/ the reusable code is stored
    # checkout is an action that copies the repository to the runner, so this is often required and the first step
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      -
        name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      -
        name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      -
        name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/personal-website:latest
      
  deploy:
    needs: build_and_push
    # creates a production environment
    environment: 
      name: Production
      url: https://billylee.me
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Installing SSH key
      uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.9.0
      with:
        ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.DROPLET_SSH_KEY }}
      
    # here we use the run command to run a command-line command
    # on the other hand, the uses command is used to run a predefined action  
    - name: Deploy to DigitalOcean Droplet
    # the pipe symbol is used to run a multiline command
      run: |
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@${{ secrets.DROPLET_IP }} << 'EOF'
          cd /root/personal-website
          docker compose pull
          docker compose up -d
        EOF
```
Note that each job in a workflow runs in a fresh virtual environment, so they run in parallel by default. If we have a job that depends on another job, we can use the `needs` keyword to specify the dependency. In the example above, the `deploy` job depends on the `build_and_push` job, so it will only run after the `build_and_push` job has completed successfully.

Also make sure that you have the necessary secrets set up in your repository settings, for example, `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, `DROPLET_SSH_KEY`, and `DROPLET_IP` in the example above.
