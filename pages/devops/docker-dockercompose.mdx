# Docker and Docker Compose
Docker is a platform to containerize applications and services. This enables developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Installation
On Ubuntu, the following commands can be used to install Docker and Docker Compose:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
On Windows and Mac, install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

## Docker
As an example, we can run the command `docker run --interactive --tty debian` to run a Debian container. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, so their file systems are separate.

### Containers and Images
A container is a runtime instance of an image. An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.

### Docker Architecture
![Docker Architecture](/images/devops/docker-dockercompose/architecture.png)

The Docker daemon is a service application that runs on the host operating system. It is responsible for managing containers and images. To make the daemon do all these stuff, we need the Docker CLI, which can execute commands such as `docker run`, `docker pull` and `docker build`. The `docker build` builds a new container image. The `docker pull` pulls an image from a registry. The `docker run` runs a container from an image.

The container registry is like a big cloud storage where developers can upload their images. One such example is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

### Docker Hub
On Docker Hub, we can look up images of different applications. For example, there are Ubuntu, Debian, etc. The Alpine Linux image is a very small image, which is often used as a base image to build other images. When we click on the Ubuntu image for example, we can see that there are different tags (versions) of the image. By default, `docker pull ubuntu` pulls the latest version of the image. This downloads the image onto the host system, and we can run the image using `docker run ubuntu`. If we want to pull a specific version, we can use `docker pull ubuntu:20.04`. On the host machine, we can see the images using `docker images`. To remove an image, we can use `docker rmi <image_id>`.

### Building Docker Images

#### Why do we Build Docker Images?
We can add containerize our own apps, services, and other code such as Python, NodeJS, and Go, etc. Furthermore, we can apply security updates ourselves, configure settings, and install our own packages. For example, we can install LaTeX on an Ubuntu image.

#### How to Build Docker Images
To build a Docker image, we need to create a `Dockerfile`. This file contains the instructions to build the image. The first line of the `Dockerfile` is the `FROM` instruction, which specifies the base image. Then we have the `RUN` instruction, which runs a command in the container. For example, we could have `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3`. After we have created our Dockerfile, we run `docker build -t <image_name> .` to build the image. The `-t` flag is used to tag the image with a name. The `.` specifies the build context, which is the directory where the Dockerfile is located. The build context is sent to the Docker daemon, which uses it to build the image.
```Dockerfile
FROM debian:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
```

#### Understanding Docker Image Layers
When we build a Docker image, each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer. The first layer is always the base image layer, created from the `FROM` statement. This is the foundation for any container image, containing the operating system and the basic tools. 

The next layers are the instruction layers. Each line in the Dockerfile creates a new layer, they are then stacked on top of the base image layer. The instruction layers are created from the `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, and `CMD` statements. The difference between the `RUN` and `CMD` statements is that the `RUN` instruction executes a command at the time when the container is being built. The `CMD` instruction specifies the command to run when the container is started. For example, we can have `CMD ["yarn", "start"]` to start a NodeJS application. The `COPY` instruction copies a file or folder from the source directory into the container file system.

The last layer is the writable container layer.

Each layer is cached by Docker, so if we change a line in the Dockerfile, only the layers after the change will be rebuilt. This is why it is important to put the instructions that change the most at the bottom of the Dockerfile.

Here is an example of a Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```
#### Dockerfile Instructions
| INSTRUCTION | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| `FROM image:tag` | Specifies the base image |
| `RUN command` | Runs a command in the container |
| `COPY source destination` | Copies files from the build context into the container |
| `WORKDIR path` | Sets the working directory for the container |
| `ADD source destination` | Copies files from the build context into the container |
| `CMD ["command", "param1", ...]` | Specifies the command to run when the container is started |
| `ENTRYPOINT ["command", "param1", ...]` | Specifies the command to run when the container is started |
| `EXPOSE port/protocol` | Exposes a port from the container |
| `ENV key=value` | Sets an environment variable |
| `ARG name=defaultvalue` | Defines a build-time variable |
| `USER username:group` | Sets the user for the container |

## Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. The YAML file is most commonly named `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.yaml`, but can be named anything. For example, if the file is named `docker-compose.production.yml`, we can use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up` to start the services. Then we can use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down` to take down the containers, or `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml stop` to stop the containers (containers can be restarted with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml start`).

### Docker Compose File
The first line of the `docker-compose.yml` file is the version of the Compose file format. We can just use `version: "3"`. Then, we define the containers and their services. 

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
    webserver:
        image: nginx:latest
        restart: always # Other options, no, on-failure, always, unless-stopped
        ports: # Expose ports, host:container
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
        volumes: # Bind mount volumes
            - /path/to/local:/path/to/container
        depends_on: # Will only start after the db service has started
            - db
        links: # Adds a host entry for the db service, so in webserver, we can use the url db to connect to the db service
            - db 
        networks: # Can connect to more than 1 network
            - network1
            - network2
    db:
        image: mysql:latest
        restart: always
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password # should use .env file
        volumes:
            - /path/to/local:/var/lib/mysql
        networks:
            - network1
networks: 
    network1:
        name: my-pre-existing-network
        external: true
    network2:
        name: my-pre-existing-network2
        external: true
```
## .dockerignore
The `.dockerignore` file is a configuration file that describes files and directories that you want to exclude when building a docker image. We can use it to avoid inadvertently sending files or directories that are large or contain sensitive files to the docker daemon or avoid adding them to the image using the `ADD` or `COPY` instructions. The common files and directories to ignore are
- `.git`
- `.gitignore`
- `.dockerignore`
- `.env`
- `node_modules`
- `*.log`
- `*.tmp`
- `*.swp`
- `.DS_Store`
- `README.md`
