# Positions
- Static positioning is the default positioning of an element. It is not affected by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `z-index` properties.
- Relative positioning is affected by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `z-index` properties.
- Absolute positioning is affected by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `z-index` properties. The position of the element does not affect the position of other elements. So it is useful for modals, image with caption on it, and icons on top of other elements.
- Fixed positioning is affected by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `z-index` properties. The position of the element does not affect the position of other elements. The position is relative to the `viewport`, so user scrolls do not affect it's position. Good for navigation bars and headers.
- Sticky positioning acts like normal elements until you scroll past them, then they start behaving like fixed elements.
