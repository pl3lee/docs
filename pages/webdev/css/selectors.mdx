# Selectors
## Universal Selector
The universal selector (`*`) selects all elements in the document. 
## Type Selector
The type selector (`<element name>`) selects all elements of the specified type. For example, `p` will select all `p` elements.
## Class Selector
The class selector (`.<class name>`) selects all elements with the specified class. For example, `.red` will select all elements with the class `red`.
## ID Selector
The ID selector (`#<id name>`) selects the element with the specified ID. For example, `#main` will select the element with the ID `main`.
## Grouping Selector
The grouping selector (`<selector 1>, <selector 2>, ...`) selects all elements that match any of the specified selectors. For example, `p, .red` will select all `p` elements and all elements with the class `red`.
## Chaining Selector
The chaining selector (`<selector 1><selector 2>`) selects all elements that match both of the specified selectors. For example, `p.red` will select all `p` elements with the class `red`.
## Descendant Combinator
The descendant combinator (`<selector 1> <selector 2>`) selects all elements that match the second selector and are descendants of elements that match the first selector. For example, `div p` will select all `p` elements that are descendants of `div` elements.
## Child Combinator
The child combinator (`>`) selects only the direct children of an element. For example, `div > p` will select all `p` elements that are direct children of a `div` element.
## Adjacent Sibling Combinator
The adjacent sibling combinator (`+`) selects only the element that is immediately after another element. For example, suppose we have the following HTML:
```html
<main class="parent">
  <div class="child group1">
    <div class="grand-child group1"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="child group2">
    <div class="grand-child group2"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="child group3">
    <div class="grand-child group3"></div>
  </div>
</main>
```
Then, `.group1 + div` will only select the div with the class `child group2`.

`group1 + div + div` will only select the div with the class `child group3`.
## General Sibling Combinator
The general sibling combinator (`~`) selects all elements that are siblings of another element. For example, `.group1 ~ div` from the previous example will select all divs with the class `child group2` and `child group3`.
## Pseudo Classes
- `:focus` selects an element that is currently focused.
- `:hover` selects an element that is currently being hovered over.
- `:active` selects an element that is currently being clicked on.
- `:link` selects an element that is a link and has not been visited.
- `:visited` selects an element that is a link and has been visited.
- `:root` selects the root element (either `:root` or `html`).
- `:first-child` and `:last-child` select the first and last child of an element, respectively.
- `:empty` selects an element that has no children.
- `:only-child` selects an element that is the only child of its parent.
- `:nth-child(<n>)` selects the nth child of an element. For example, `:nth-child(2)` selects the second child of an element.
## Pseudo Elements
- `::before` inserts content before the selected element.
- `::after` inserts content after the selected element.
- `::marker` allows you to customize the styling of `<li>` elements' bullets or numbers.
- `::first-letter` and `::first-line` allow you to customize the styling of the first letter and first line of an element, respectively.
- `::selection` allows you to customize the styling of selected text.
## Attribute Selector
- `[<attribute name>]` selects all elements that have the specified attribute. For example, `[href]` will select all elements that have an `href` attribute.
- `<selector>[<attribute name]` selects all elements that match the specified selector and have the specified attribute. For example, `a[href]` will select all `a` elements that have an `href` attribute.
- `[<attribute name>="<attribute value>"]` selects all elements that have the specified attribute with the specified value. For example, `[href="https://www.google.com"]` will select all elements that have an `href` attribute with the value `https://www.google.com`.
- regex:
```css
[class^='aus'] {
  /* Classes are attributes too!
    This will target any class that begins with 'aus':
    class='austria'
    class='australia'
  */
}

[src$='.jpg'] {
  /* This will target any src attribute that ends in '.jpg':
  src='puppy.jpg'
  src='kitten.jpg'
  */
}

[for*='ill'] {
  /* This will target any for attribute that has 'ill' anywhere inside it:
  for="bill"
  for="jill"
  for="silly"
  for="ill"
  */
}
```
