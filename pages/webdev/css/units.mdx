- em: font size of an element. For example, if an element has a font size of `16px`, then `1em` is `16px`, `2em` is `32px`, and so on.
- rem: font size of the root element (either `:root` or `html`). Using `rem` is recommended.
- vh: viewport height. `1vh` is `1%` of the viewport height.
- vw: viewport width. `1vw` is `1%` of the viewport width.
- dvh: dynamic viewport height. `1dvh` is `1%` of the dynamic viewport height. We should use this because this accounts for the address bar and other browser UI elements that can change the viewport height.
- dvw: dynamic viewport width. `1dvw` is `1%` of the dynamic viewport width. We should use this because this accounts for the address bar and other browser UI elements that can change the viewport width.
