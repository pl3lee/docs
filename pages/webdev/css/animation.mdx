# Animation
## Transforms
- The transform property changes the appearance of elements without affecting the natural document flow
- Almost all elements can be transformed, except `<col>, <colgroup>`, and non-replaced inline elements (such as `<span>, <b>, <em>`)
- There are 2D and 3D transforms

### 2D Transforms

#### Rotate
Rotates an element on a 2D plane
```css
.rotate-by-deg {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
.rotate-by-rad {
  transform: rotate(-1rad);
}
.rotate-by-turn {
  transform: rotate(0.25turn);
}
```
#### Scale
Scales an element on a 2D plane
```css
.scaleX {
  transform: scaleX(2);
}
.scaleY {
  transform: scaleY(0.5);
}
.scaleXY {
  transform: scale(2, 0.5);
}
```
#### Skew
Skew an element on a 2D plane (for example, turning a square into a parallelogram)
```css
.skewX {
  transform: skewX(45deg);
}
.skewY {
  transform: skewY(-0.5rad);
}
.skewXY {
  transform: skew(45deg, -0.5rad);
}
.skew {
  transform: skew(45deg);
}
```
Note that `skew()` behaves the same way as `skewX()` if there is only a single value passed to it.
#### Translate
Moves an element on a 2D plane
```css
.translateX {
  transform: translateX(100px);
}
.translateY {
  transform: translateY(-33%);
}
.translateXY {
  transform: translate(100px, -33%);
}
```
Note that percentage values are relative to the element's width.
### Chaining Transforms
Transforms can be chained together by adding a space between each one.
```css
.rotate-and-scale {
  transform: rotate(45deg) scale(2);
}
```
Note that order matters (left to right).
### 3D Transforms

#### Perspective
Sets the distance from the user to the z=0 plane (distance from the user to the screen)

See [this](https://css-tricks.com/how-css-perspective-works/) for examples on how perspective works.
#### Rotate
Rotates an element on a 3D plane
```css
.element {
  transform: rotateX();
  transform: rotateY();
  transform: rotateZ();
  transform: rotate3d();
}
```
See [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate3d) on how rotate3d works.
#### Scale
Scales an element on a 3D plane
```css
.element {
  transform: scaleZ();
  transform: scale3d();
}
```
[scaleZ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/scaleZ) and [scale3d](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/scale3d) examples.
#### Translate
Moves an element on a 3D plane
```css
.element {
  transform: perspective(100px) translateZ(30px);
}
```

## Transitions
- Transitions let you animate a change from an element's initial state to an end state.
- `transition` is a shorthand property for `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, and `transition-delay`.
- We add the `transition` properties and the initial state to the base class. Then we have a class that has properties for the end state. When we add the class with the end state properties, the transition will occur.
- For the best performance, we should use `transform` and `opacity` for transitions.

### transition-property
Determines what CSS property will be transitioned.
### transition-duration
Determines the duration that the transition will occur over.
### transition-timing-function
Lets us change the speed of the transition over the course of its duration. For example, `ease-out` will start the transition quickly and slow down towards the end.
### transition-delay
Determines the delay at which the transition will start.

### Shorthand property
The shorthand property looks like
```
transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;
```

## Keyframes

### Animations vs Transitions
- Animations and transitions are similar in that they both change the appearance of an element over time.
- Animations were designed with the purpose of looping
- Transitions need a trigger, like `:hover`, or `:focus`, or adding/removing a class via Javascript. Animations do not need triggers.

### Animation Properties
Put these properties on the base class
```css
#ball {
  <!-- other CSS properties -->
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-name: change-color;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}
```
#### animation-duration
Determines how long the animation will take to complete one cycle.
#### animation-name
Defines the name of the animation so we can reference it in the `@keyframes` rule.
#### animation-iteration-count
Determines how many times the animation will play. The default is `1`, but we can set it to `infinite` to make it loop forever.
#### animation-direction
Determines the direction of the animation. The default is `normal` which resets to the start point and repeat itself, or `alternate` which plays the animation forwards, then backwards, then forwards, etc.

### Keyframes
Example:
```css
@keyframes change-color {
  from {
    background-color: red;
  }

  to {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
```
Note that keyframes use a percentage to indicate the times for an animation to take place. So `from` and `to` are aliases for `0%` and `100%` respectively.

### Shorthand
We can also use shorthand `animation`
```css
#ball {
  /* ... other CSS properties ... */
  background-color: red;
  animation: 2s change-color infinite alternate;
}

@keyframes change-color {
  from {
    background-color: red;
  }
  
  50% {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: blue;
  }

  to {
    background-color: green;
  }
}
```
