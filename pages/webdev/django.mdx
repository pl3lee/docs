# Django
This will follow the quick start [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/) from Django's website.
## Installation
```bash
python -m pip install Django
```
## Creating a Project
We first create a project using the following command:
```bash
django-admin startproject mysite .
```
which creates a directory named `mysite` in the current directory.
<FileTree>
    <FileTree.File name="manage.py"/>
    <FileTree.Folder name="mysite">
        <FileTree.File name="__init__.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="asgi.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="settings.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="urls.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="wsgi.py"/>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
- `manage.py` is a command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways.
- The `mysite` directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you'll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. `mysite.urls`).
- `mysite/__init__.py` is an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
- `mysite/settings.py` is the settings/configuration for this Django project.
- `mysite/urls.py` is the URL declarations for this Django project; a "table of contents" of your Django-powered site.
- `mysite/asgi.py` and `mysite/wsgi.py` are the entry points for ASGI and WSGI servers, respectively.

We can then run the server using the following command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
And our development server starts on port 8000. If you want to change the port, you can do so by running the following command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver 8080
```
If you want to run the server on a specific IP address, you can do so by running the following command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
## Creating an App
Now that the project is setup, we can start creating apps. Each app you write in Django consists of a Python package that follows a certain convention. The difference between a project and an app is that an app is a web application that does something â€“ e.g., a database of public records or a simple poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.

Let's create our poll app in the same directory as our `manage.py` file:
```bash
python manage.py startapp polls
```
This creates a directory named `polls` in the current directory.
<FileTree>
    <FileTree.File name="manage.py"/>
    <FileTree.Folder name="mysite">
        <FileTree.File name="__init__.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="asgi.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="settings.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="urls.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="wsgi.py"/>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="polls">
        <FileTree.File name="__init__.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="admin.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="apps.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="models.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="tests.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="views.py"/>
        <FileTree.Folder name="migrations">
            <FileTree.File name="__init__.py"/>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
## Writing your first view
Let's write our first view. Open the file `polls/views.py` and put the following code in it:
```python filename="polls/views.py"
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
```
This is the simplest view possible in Django. To call the view, we need to map it to a URL - and for this we need a URLconf.

URLconf is responsible for mapping URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to views in your Django project. It determines how incoming requests are handled and which view function or class-based view should be called to generate the response.

To create a URLconf in the polls directory, create a file called `urls.py`. Your app directory should now look like this:
<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="polls">
        <FileTree.File name="__init__.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="admin.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="apps.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="models.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="tests.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="views.py"/>
        <FileTree.File name="urls.py"/>
        <FileTree.Folder name="migrations">
            <FileTree.File name="__init__.py"/>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
In the `polls/urls.py` file, include the following code:
```python filename="polls/urls.py"
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
]
```
Then we can point the root `URLconf` at the `polls.urls` module. In `mysite/urls.py`, add an import for `django.urls.include` and insert an `include()` in the `urlpatterns` list, so you have:
```python filename="mysite/urls.py"
"""
URL configuration for mysite project.

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path("polls/", include("polls.urls")),
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
]
```
The `include()` function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters `include()`, it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.

Now when we go to `http://localhost:8000/polls`, we should see the text "Hello, world. You're at the polls index.".

The `path()` function is passed four arguments, two required: `route` and `view`, and two optional: `kwargs` and `name`.
- `route` is a string that contains a URL pattern. When processing a request, Django starts at the first pattern in `urlpatterns` and makes its way down the list, comparing the requested URL against each pattern until it finds one that matches.
- `view` is a view function that Django should call when the pattern is matched.
- `kwargs` is an arbitrary keyword argument that can be passed to the target view.
- `name` is the name of the URL that will be used to identify the view. Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates. This allows you to make global changes to the URL patterns of your project while only touching a single file.

## Database Setup
Now open `mysite/settings.py`. This is a normal Pytho module with module-level variables representing Django settings. Let's see the `DATABSES` setting:
```python filename="mysite/settings.py"
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
        "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
    }
}
```
By default, the configuration uses SQLite. SQLite is included in Python, so you won't need to install anything else to support your database. When starting your first real project, however, you may want to use a more scalable database like PostgreSQL, to avoid database-switching headaches down the road. Let's just use SQLite for now. While we're in `settings.py`, let's set the `TIME_ZONE` to our local time zone EST
```python filename="mysite/settings.py"
TIME_ZONE = "America/New_York"
```
Also take a look at the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:
```python filename="mysite/settings.py"
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "polls.apps.PollsConfig",
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
]
```
This holds the names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django instance. Apps can be used in multiple projects, and you can package and distribute them for use by others in their projects.
- `django.contrib.admin` is the Django admin application. You'll use it later in this tutorial.
- `django.contrib.auth` is an authentication system.
- `django.contrib.contenttypes` is a framework for content types.
- `django.contrib.sessions` is a session framework.
- `django.contrib.messages` is a messaging framework.
- `django.contrib.staticfiles` is a framework for managing static files.

Some of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
This creates any necessary database tables according to the database settings in `mysite/settings.py` and the database migrations shipped with the app.
## Creating Models
This is essentially the database layout, with additional metadata. In our poll app, we'll create two models: `Question` and `Choice`. A `Question` has a question and a publication date. A `Choice` has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally. Each `Choice` is associated with a `Question`. Edit the `polls/models.py` file and add the following code:
```python filename="polls/models.py"
from django.db import models


class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published")


class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
```
We can see that each model is inherited from `django.db.models.Model`. Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model. Then, each field is represented by an instance of a `django.db.models.Field` class - e.g., `CharField` for character fields and `DateTimeField` for datetimes. This tells Django what type of data each field holds. The name of each `Field` instance (e.g., `question_text` or `pub_date`) is the field's name, in machine-friendly format. You'll use this value in your Python code, and your database will use it as the column name.

You can use an optional first positional argument to a `Field` to designate a human-readable name. For example, we have defined a human-readable name for the `pub_date` field.

Some `Field` classes have required arguments. `CharField`, for example, requires that you give it a `max_length`. That's used not only in the database schema, but in validation, as we'll soon see. A `Field` can also have various optional arguments; in this case, we've set the default value of `votes` to 0.

Finally, notice the `ForeignKey` is defined, which tells Django each `Choice` is related to a single `Question`. Django supports all the common database relationships: many-to-one, many-to-many, and one-to-one.

## Activating Models
The model code we wrote above gives Django a lot of information. With it, Django is able to:
- Create a database schema (CREATE TABLE statements) for this app.
- Create a Python database-access API for accessing `Question` and `Choice` objects.

But first we need to tell our project that the `polls` app is installed. Edit the `mysite/settings.py` file and add that `polls` is installed:
```python filename="mysite/settings.py"
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "polls.apps.PollsConfig",
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
]
```
Then let's run the following command to create a migration for our models:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations polls
```
Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - they're just files on disk. You can read the migration for the `polls` app in the file `polls/migrations/0001_initial.py`. 

IF you would like to see what SQL commands will be run before you do a migration, you can do
```bash
python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
```
If needed, you can also run the following command to check for any problems in your project without making migrations or touching the database:
```bash
python manage.py check
```
Now, run the following command to apply the migration:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
The `migrate` takes all the `migrations` that haven't been applied and runs them against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made to your models with the schema in the database. So, here is a 3-step guide to making model changes:
- Change your models (in `models.py`).
- Run `python manage.py makemigrations` to create migrations for those changes.
- Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply those changes to the database.

## Playing with the API
Now, let's try out the free API that Django gives you. First, let's start the Python interactive interpreter:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```
Then we can create a `Question` object using the following code:
```python
# This imports the Question and Choice model, allowing us to create new questions
>>> from polls.models import Question, Choice

# We can check that no questions are in the database
>>> Question.objects.all()
"<QuerySet []>"

# Now, let's create a new Question
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> q = Question(question_text="What's new?", pub_date=timezone.now())

# Save the object into the database
>>> q.save()

# Now, let's check the questions again
>>> q.question_text
"What's new?"

# We can change values by changing the attributes and calling save()
>>> q.question_text = "What's up?"
>>> q.save()

# Display all the questions in the database
>>> Question.objects.all()
"<QuerySet [<Question: Question object (1)>]>"
```
But this isn't particularly useful. Let's add a custom method to the `Question` model to display the question text:
```python filename="polls/models.py"
from django.db import models

class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published")
    def __str__(self):
        return self.question_text


class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
     def __str__(self):
        return self.choice_text
```
It's important to add `__str__` methods to your models, not only for your own convenience when dealing with the interactive prompt, but also because objects' representations are used throughout Django's automatically-generated admin.

Let's also add a custom method to the `Question` model to display the publication date:
```python filename="polls/models.py"
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

class Question(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published")
    def __str__(self):
        return self.question_text
    def was_published_recently(self):
        return self.pub_date >= timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)


class Choice(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
     def __str__(self):
        return self.choice_text
```
Save this and run `python manage.py shell` again.
```python
>>> from polls.models import Choice, Question

# Display all the questions in the database
>>> Question.objects.all()
"<QuerySet [<Question: What's up?>]>"

# Try filtering
>>> Question.objects.filter(id=1)
"<QuerySet [<Question: What's up?>]>"
>>> Question.objects.filter(question_text__startswith="What")
"<QuerySet [<Question: What's up?>]>"

# Get the question that was published this year
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> current_year = timezone.now().year
>>> Question.objects.get(pub_date__year=current_year)
"<Question: What's up?>"

# Request an ID that doesn't exist, this will raise an exception.
>>> Question.objects.get(id=2)
"""
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
DoesNotExist: Question matching query does not exist.
"""

# Lookup using primary key, this is identical to Question.objects.get(id=1)
>>> Question.objects.get(pk=1)
"<Question: What's up?>"

# Make sure the custom method works
>>> q = Question.objects.get(pk=1)
>>> q.was_published_recently()
"True"

# Give the Question a couple of Choices. The create call constructs a new
# Choice object, does the INSERT statement, adds the choice to the set
# of available choices and returns the new Choice object. Django creates
# a set to hold the "other side" of a ForeignKey relation
# (e.g. a question's choice) which can be accessed via the API.
>>> q = Question.objects.get(pk=1)

# Display any choices from the related object set -- none so far.
>>> q.choice_set.all()
"<QuerySet []>"

# Create three choices.
>>> q.choice_set.create(choice_text="Not much", votes=0)
"<Choice: Not much>"
>>> q.choice_set.create(choice_text="The sky", votes=0)
"<Choice: The sky>"
>>> c = q.choice_set.create(choice_text="Just hacking again", votes=0)
"<Choice: Just hacking again>"

# Choice objects have API access to their related Question objects.
>>> c.question
"<Question: What's up?>"

# And vice versa: Question objects get access to Choice objects.
>>> q.choice_set.all()
"<QuerySet [<Choice: Not much>, <Choice: The sky>, <Choice: Just hacking again>]>"
>>> q.choice_set.count()
"3"

# The API automatically follows relationships as far as you need.
# Use double underscores to separate relationships.
# This works as many levels deep as you want; there's no limit.
# Find all Choices for any question whose pub_date is in this year
# (reusing the 'current_year' variable we created above).
>>> Choice.objects.filter(question__pub_date__year=current_year)
"<QuerySet [<Choice: Not much>, <Choice: The sky>, <Choice: Just hacking again>]>"

# Let's delete one of the choices. Use delete() for that.
>>> c = q.choice_set.filter(choice_text__startswith="Just hacking")
>>> c.delete()
```
