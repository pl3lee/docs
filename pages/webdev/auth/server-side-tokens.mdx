# Server-side Tokens
A server-side token is any long, random string that is stored on the server. It may be persisted in a database or in-memory data store(e.g. Redis) and is used for authentication and verification. A token can be validated by checking if it exists in storage. Examples include session IDs, email verification tokens, and access tokens. For example, a database table that stores session IDs might look like this:
```sql
CREATE TABLE token (
	token STRING NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	expires_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
	user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,

	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(id)
)
```
For single-use tokens, any retrieval should also guarantee deletion. In SQL for example, an atomic operation such as a transaction should be used when fetching a token.

## Generating Tokens
Tokens must be generated using a cryptographically secure random generator. Fast, pseudo-random generators like those generally provided by standard math packages should be avoided for this. Tokens should be case-sensitive, but you may want to constrain your token generation to lowercase letters if your storage is case-insensitive (e.g. MySQL).
```go
import (
	"crypto/rand"
	"encoding/base32"
)

// Creates a slice of 15 bytes. This slice will be filled with random data
bytes := make([]byte, 15)

// Fills the slice with cryptographically secure random data. Each byte can have 256 different values (from 0 to 255), so the total number of possible combinations is 256^15
rand.Read(bytes)

// Converts the byte slice into a Base32-encoded string. Base32 encoding is used to make the string URL-safe and file-system friendly
sessionId := base32.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(bytes)
```
## Storing Tokens
Tokens that require an extra level of security, such as password reset tokens, should be hashed with SHA-256. Tokens can be validated by hashing the incoming token before querying.
