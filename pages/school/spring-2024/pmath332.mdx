# PMATH 332: Applied Complex Analysis
This is mainly a calculus course, which will extend the concepts of calculus to complex numbers.

## Lecture 1 (May 6, 2024)
### Fundamentals
First consider $\sqrt{-1} \sqrt{-1}$. We can interpret it in 2 ways:
1. $\sqrt{-1} \sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{(-1)(-1)} = \sqrt{1} = 1$
2. $\sqrt{-1} \sqrt{-1} = (\sqrt{-1})^2 = -1$

The problem is the notation. So we need to define complex numbers without using the $\sqrt{\cdot}$ symbol. 
<Definition withName={true} id="defn-imaginary-unit">
    <DefinitionName>Imaginary Unit</DefinitionName>
    <DefinitionContent>
        The imaginary unit $i$ is defined by the property $i^2 = -1$.
    </DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
We can now define a complex number as an ordered pair with a special notation.
<Definition withName={true} id="defn-complex-number">
    <DefinitionName>Complex Number</DefinitionName>
    <DefinitionContent>
        A complex number is an expression 
        $$
        z = a + ib, \quad a, b \in \mathbb{R}
        $$
        where $\def\Re{\operatorname{Re}} a = \Re(z)$ is the real part and $\def\Im{\operatorname{Im}}b = \Im(z)$ is the imaginary part.
    </DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The imaginary part is real.
</Callout>
Now, the set of all complex numbers is $\mathbb C$, and $\mathbb R$ is a subset of $\mathbb C$: $\mathbb R \subset \mathbb C$. The laws of commutativity, associativity, and distributivity hold in $\mathbb C$, and we have the following rules of arithmetic.
<Definition withName={true} id="defn-rules-of-arithmetic">
<DefinitionName>Rules of Arithmetic</DefinitionName>
<DefinitionContent>
Let $z = a + bi$ and $w = c + di$.
1. Then $z = w$ iff $a = c$ and $b = d$.
2. $z + w = (a + c) + (b + d)i$.
3. $z - w = z + (-w) = (a - c) + (b - d)i$.
4. $zw = (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$.
5. $\frac{z}{w} = \frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \left( \frac{a + bi}{c + di}\right)\left( \frac{c - di}{c - di}\right) = \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2} = \frac{ac + bd}{c^2 + d^2} + \left( \frac{bc - ad}{c^2 + d^2}\right)i$
</DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
As an example, we have
<Example>
<ExampleContent>
$$
\frac{2 + i}{1 + 2i} = \frac{2 + i}{1 + 2i} \frac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \frac{4 - 3i}{5}
$$
</ExampleContent>
</Example>
We also have the following useful result.
<Lemma>
<LemmaContent>
We have
$$
\frac{1}{i} = \frac{1}{i} \frac{i}{i} = \frac{i}{i^2} = \frac{i}{-1} = -i
$$
That is,
$$
\frac{1}{i} = -i
$$
</LemmaContent>
</Lemma>
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Complex numbers cannot be described as positive or negative, and they cannot be ordered ($z < w$ is nonsensical).
</Callout>
<Definition withName={true}>
<DefinitionName>Complex Conjugate</DefinitionName>
<DefinitionContent>
The complex conjugate of $z = a + bi$ is $\overline{z} = a - bi$. An alternative notation is $z^*$.
</DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
The following properties hold for the complex conjugate.
<Lemma withName={true}>
<LemmaName>Properties of Conjugate</LemmaName>
<LemmaContent>
1. $\overline{\overline{z}} = z$.
2. $\overline{z \pm w} = \overline{z} \pm \overline{w}$.
3. $\overline{zw} = \overline{z} \overline{w}$.
4. $\overline{\left( \frac{z}{w}\right)} = \frac{\overline{z}}{\overline{w}}$.
5. $z + \overline{z} = (a + bi) + (a - bi) = 2a$
6. $z - \overline{z} = (a + bi) - (a - bi) = 2bi$
7. $z\overline{z} = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2$
</LemmaContent>
</Lemma>
And thus a useful identity is
$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{Re}(z) &= \frac{1}{2} (z + \overline{z}) \\
    \mathrm{Im}(z) &= \frac{1}{2i} (z - \overline{z})
\end{align*}
$$

## Lecture 2 (May 6, 2024)
### Complex Plane
We can associate complex numbers with points in a plane.

![Complex Plane](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/2-1.png)

The complex number $z$ can be treated as a vector, and the length of the vector is called the modulus of $z$.
<Definition withName={true} id="defn-modulus">
<DefinitionName>Modulus</DefinitionName>
<DefinitionContent>
The modulus of $z = a + bi$ is $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. This is the distance of $z$ from the origin. The distance between two numbers $z$ and $w$ is $|z - w|$
</DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
So, even though we cannot write $z_1 < z_2$, we can write $|z_1| < |z_2|$.

We can imagine graphs of $|z|$, $\mathrm{Re}(z)$, and $\mathrm{Im}(z)$ as surfaces above the complex plane. These are functions that have 2 inputs and 1 output. More generally though, our functions will be complex valued (meaning that graphs would require 4 dimensions).

So, the equation $|z - z_0| = r$ represents a circle of radius $r$ centered at $z_0$.

<Example>
<ExampleContent>
Sketch the sets
- $|z| < 3$

This is a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin.

![Circle](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/2-2.png)

- $|z| = \mathrm{Im}(z)$

We have $z = x + yi$, so we have the equation
$$
\begin{align*}
    \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} &= y \\
    x^2 + y^2 &= y^2 \\
    x^2 &= 0 \\
    x &= 0 
\end{align*}
$$
with $y$ non-negative. So, we have the positive $y$-axis.

![Positive Y-Axis](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/2-3.png)

- $|z - 1| = |z + i|$

We have $z = x + yi$, then 
$$
\begin{align*}
    |z - 1| &= |(x - 1) + yi| = \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2} \\
    |z + i| &= |x + (y + 1)i| = \sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2}
\end{align*}
$$
So we have the equation
$$
\begin{align*}
    \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2} &= \sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2} \\
    (x - 1)^2 + y^2 &= x^2 + (y + 1)^2 \\
    x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 &= x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 \\
    -2x &= 2y \\
    y &= -x
\end{align*}
$$
Alternatively, we can think of this as the set of points $z$, where the distance from $z$ to 1 is equal to the distance from $z$ to $-i$. 

![Line](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/2-4.png)
</ExampleContent>
</Example>

### Triangle Inequality
We have
1. $|z_1 + z_2| \leq |z_1| + |z_2|$, and the extended version

    $|z_1 + z_2 + \cdots + z_n| \leq |z_1| + |z_2| + \cdots + |z_n|$
2. $|z_1 + z_2| \geq |z_1| - |z_2|$

### Polar Form
Since $z = x + yi$ can be viewed as a point in a plane, we can describe its location in polar coordinates.

![Polar Coordinates](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/2-5.png)

By trigonometry, we have $x = r \cos \theta$ and $y = r \sin \theta$ and thus
$$
\begin{align*}
    z &= x + yi \\
    &= r \cos \theta + r \sin \theta i \\
    &= r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \\
    &= r \mathrm{cis}( \theta)
\end{align*}
$$
Of course, $r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}$. We call $\theta$ the argument of $z$ and write $\theta = \arg(z)$.

Note that $\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \pm 2 \pi k$ for any $k \in \mathbb Z_{\neq 0}$ if $x > 0$. If $x < 0$, then we must add or subtract $\pi$. We illustrate this on an example:

![example](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/2-6.png)

We have $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-1}{-1}\right)$, so this gives the wrong angle. Thus, we must fix it by adding or subtracting $\pi$ to get the correct $\theta$.
#### Why use polar form?
Watch what happens with multiplication
$$
\begin{align*}
    z_1 z_2 &= r_1(\cos \theta_1 + i \sin\theta_1) r_2(\cos \theta_2 + i \sin\theta_2) \\
    &= r_1r_2 \left[\cos\theta_1 \theta_2 - \sin\theta_1\theta_2 + i(\sin\theta_1 \cos\theta_2 + \cos\theta_1 \sin\theta_2)\right] \\
    &= r_1r_2 \left[\cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + i \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)\right] \\
    &= r_1r_2 \mathrm{cis}(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\end{align*}
$$
where we used the trigonometric identities $\cos(a + b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b$ and $\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b$.

That is, $|z_1 z_2| = |z_1||z_2|$ and $\arg(z_1 z_2) = \arg(z_1) + \arg(z_2)$. So multiplying $z_1$ by $z_2$ magnifies $z_1$ by $|z_2|$ and rotates it by $\arg(z_2)$.

Similarly, 
$$
\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} \mathrm{cis}(\theta_1 - \theta_2)
$$
Euler noticed this behaviour is similar to multiplying exponentials, $(a_1e^{b_1}) (a_2e^{b_2}) = a_1a_2 e^{b_1 + b_2}$, so we define the Euler's formula
<Definition withName={true}>
<DefinitionName>Euler's Formula</DefinitionName>
<DefinitionContent>
$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
$$
</DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
Then we can use properties of $e^x$ instead of trigonometric identities!

## Lecture 3 (May 8, 2024)
### Polar and Exponential Form (Continued)
From last lecture, we wrote $z = x + iy = re^{i\theta}$, where $r = |z|$.
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  $|e^{i\theta}| = 1$ for all $\theta$. This is because
  $$
  |e^{i\theta}| = |\cos \theta + i \sin \theta| = \sqrt{\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta} = 1
  $$

</Callout>
We extend the definition of $\arg$ and we define $\arg(z)$ to be the **set** of all possible values of $\theta$ which can be used to describe $z$, instead of just a single value $\theta$.

From Lecture 2, we wrote
$$
\arg(z_1z_2) = \arg(z_1) + \arg(z_2)
$$
because $z_1z_2 = r_1r_2 e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}$. However, this is problematic.

Let's consider $z_1 = z_2 = i$. Then $\arg(z_1z_2) = \arg(-1) = \pi + 2\pi k$. For RHS, we get
$$
\begin{align*}
    \arg(z_1) + \arg(z_2) &= \arg(i) + \arg(i) \\
    &= \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2 \pi k_1\right) + \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2 \pi k_2\right) \\
    &= \pi + 2\pi(k_1 + k_2)
\end{align*}
$$
That is, we have
$$
\arg(z_1z_2) = \pi + 2\pi(k_1 + k_2)
$$
However, we also have
$$
2 \arg(i) = 2 \left(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k\right) = \pi + 4 \pi k
$$
Thus we have
$$
\arg(i) + \arg(i) \neq 2 \arg(i)
$$
We wish to identify a specific value of $\arg(z)$, so we have these definition.
<Definition>
<DefinitionName>Principle Value</DefinitionName>
<DefinitionContent>
$\mathrm{Arg}(z)$ is the principle value, by which we mean the one in $(-\pi, \pi)$.
</DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
<Definition>
<DefinitionName>Branch</DefinitionName>
<DefinitionContent>
$\arg_{z_0}(z)$ is a branch of $\arg(z)$, which is the angle in the interval $[z_0, z_0 + 2\pi)$.
</DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
For example, we have $\arg_0(z)$ has range $[0, 2\pi)$.
<Definition>
<DefinitionName>Branch Cut</DefinitionName>
<DefinitionContent>
A branch cut is the angle at the endpoints of the interval.
</DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
<Example>
<ExampleContent>
Consider $\arg_{\pi / 4}(z)$. Then $\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$ is a branch cut. We also have $\theta = \frac{9\pi}{4}$ as a branch cut, but it is in a different branch.
</ExampleContent>
</Example>

### Converting from Standard Form to Exponential Form
Suppose we have $z = 1 - i$. Then we have the graph

![Graph](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/3-1.png)

We can see that $\theta = -\frac{\pi}{4}$, and the modulus is $r = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt 2$. Thus, we have
$$
z = 1 - i = \sqrt 2 e^{-i\pi/4}
$$
or
$ \sqrt 2 e^{(\frac{\pi}{4} + 2\pi k)i}$ since the angles are equivalent.

Now suppose that we have $z = -1 + \sqrt 3 i$. This is hard to graph, so let's solve this algebraically. We have
$r = |z| = \sqrt{1 + 3} = 2$. And from before,
$$
\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x} = - \sqrt 3
$$
so $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} + 2\pi k$. So
$$
z = -1 + \sqrt 3 i = 2 e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}
$$

### Converting from Exponential Form to Standard Form
The trick is to think about the unit circle.

Suppose we have $e^{\frac{\pi}{2}i}$. This is a point on the unit circle, with $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$. So clearly the point lies on the imaginary axis, and thus $z = i$.

Now suppose that $e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}i}$. This is the same case, but in the opposite direction, so $z = -i$.

Now for $e^{i\pi}$. This is a point on the unit circle, with $\theta = \pi$. So the point lies on the negative real axis, and thus $z = -1$.

Then for $e^{\frac{\pi}{4}i}$, this point lies in the first quadrant, with equal distance from the real and imaginary axes. So we can normalize $1 + i$ to get $z = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}i$.

Similarly for $e^{i\frac{3\pi}{4}}$, this point lies in the second quadrant, with equal distance from the real and imaginary axes. So we can normalize $-1 + i$ to get $z = -\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}i$.

### Advantage of Exponential Form
An advantage of exponential form is that multiplication and division **can** be easier when compared to standard form. However, addition and subtraction are easier in standard form.

An example of division being easier is to consider $z_1 = 1 + i$ and $z_2 = 1 - i$. Then we have
$$
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1 + i}{1 - i} &= \frac{\sqrt 2 e^{\frac{\pi}{4}i}}{\sqrt 2 e^{-\frac{\pi}{4}i}} \\
    &= e^{\frac{\pi}{2}i} = i
\end{align*}
$$
But it does not always become easier. Consider 
$$
\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{2 + i}{-3 + 2i}\right)(3 - i) &= \frac{\sqrt 5 e^{i \tan^{-1}(\frac{1}{2})}}{\sqrt{13} e^{i(\tan^{-1}(- \frac{2}{3}) + \pi)}} (\sqrt{10} e^{i \tan^{-1}(- \frac{1}{3})}) \\
    &= \frac{\sqrt{50}}{\sqrt{13}} e^{i(\tan^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}) - \tan^{-1}(- \frac{2}{3}) - \pi + \tan^{-1}(- \frac{1}{3}) + \pi)}
\end{align*}
$$
However, the advantage is clearer when we raise to a power.
<Theorem withName={true}>
<TheoremName>Demoivre's Formula</TheoremName>
<TheoremContent>
If $z = re^{i\theta}$, then
$$
z^n = r^n e^{in\theta} = r^n \left[\cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta)\right]
$$
</TheoremContent>
</Theorem>
Here are some examples.
<Example withName={true}>
<ExampleName> Example of using Demoivre's Formula</ExampleName>
<ExampleContent>
We have 3 examples:
$$
\begin{align*}
    (2 + 2i)^3 &= (2 \sqrt 2 e^{\frac{\pi}{4}i})^3 \\
    &= 16 \sqrt 2 e^{\frac{3\pi}{4}i} \\
    &= 16(-1 + i) \\
    (2i)^{-3} &= (2e^{\frac{\pi}{2}i})^{-3} \\
    &= \frac{1}{8} e^{-\frac{3\pi}{2}i} \\
    &= \frac{-i}{8} \\
    (\sqrt 3 + i)^5 &= (2e^{\frac{\pi}{6}i})^5 \\
    &= 32 e^{\frac{5\pi}{6}i} \\
    &= 16(- \sqrt 3 + i)
\end{align*}
$$
</ExampleContent>
</Example>

## Lecture 4 (May 10, 2024)
### Roots
Last time we discussed powers:
$$
z^n = (ie^{i\theta})^n = r^n e^{in\theta}
$$
We can use this rule for powers $\frac{1}{n}$ as well. However, in $\mathbb C$, the notation $z^{\frac{1}{n}}$ is understood to be **multi-valued**. To start, we have to write $z$ as $z = re^{i(\theta + 2\pi k)}$.

Then
$$
z^{\frac{1}{n}} = \left[re^{i\theta + 2\pi k}\right]^{\frac{1}{n}} = r^{\frac{1}{n}} e^{i(\frac{\theta}{n} + \frac{2\pi k}{n})}
$$
This gives $n$ distinct values for $z^{\frac{1}{n}}$, because as $k = n$, the second term in the exponent becomes $+ 2\pi$, which results in the same angle, and thus repeats itself.

#### Examples
<Example>
    <ExampleContent>
        Consider
        $$
        \begin{align*}
            \sqrt{-1} &= (-1)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
            &= (e^{i(\pi + 2 \pi k)})^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
            &= e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k)}
        \end{align*}
        $$
        Then
        - $k = 0$ gives $\omega_0 = e^{i\pi / 2} = i$
        - $k = 1$ gives $\omega_1 = e^{i(3\pi / 2)} = -i$
        - $k = 2$ gives $\omega_2 = e^{i(5\pi / 2)} = e^{i(\pi / 2)} = i = \omega_0$
        - $k = 3$ gives $\omega_3 = e^{i(7\pi / 2)} = e^{i(3\pi / 2)} = -i = \omega_1$

            &= \sqrt[3]{27} e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{3}} \\
            &= 3e^{i\frac{2\pi k}{3}}
        \end{align*}
        $$
        Then
        - $k = 0$ gives $\omega_0 = 3$
        - $k = 1$ gives $\omega_1 = 3e^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}} = 3(-\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt 3}{2})$
        - $k = 2$ gives $\omega_2 = 3e^{i\frac{4\pi}{3}} = 3(-\frac{1}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt 3}{2})$

            &= \sqrt 2 e^{i(\frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{\pi k}{3})} \\
        \end{align*}
        $$
        Then
        - $k = 0$ gives $\omega_0 = \sqrt 2 e^{i\frac{\pi}{6}} = \sqrt 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt 3}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i\right)$
        - $k = 1$ gives $\omega_1 = \sqrt 2 e^{i\frac{3\pi}{6}} = \sqrt 2 i$
        - $k = 2$ gives $\omega_2 = \sqrt 2 e^{i\frac{5\pi}{6}} = \sqrt 2 \left(-\frac{\sqrt 3}{2} + \frac{1}{2}i\right)$
        - $k = 3$ gives $\omega_3 = \sqrt 2 e^{i\frac{7\pi}{6}} = \sqrt 2 \left(-\frac{\sqrt 3}{2} - \frac{1}{2}i\right)$

### Applications to Circuit Analysis Impedance
By engineering convention, we use $j$ instead of $i$ to represent the imaginary unit, and $i$ as the current.

It is known from experience that if a current $i(t)$ passes through a resistor of resistance $R$, the resulting drop in electrical potential energy (voltage, $v(t)$) satisfies the equation
$$
v(t) = Ri(t)
$$
That is, $v = iR$ which is Ohm's Law. We will use an alternating current
$$
i(t) = I \sin(\omega t)
$$
where $I$ is the amplitude of the current and $\omega$ is the frequency. So we can write
$$
v_R(t) = I R \sin(\omega t)
$$
for the voltage across the resistor.

![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/4-1.png)

Now consider a capacitor. A capacitor holds charge with a capacitance $C$. The voltage across the capacitor is related to the current by
$$
v_C(t) = \frac{I}{\omega C} \sin\left(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
$$

![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/4-2.png)

Now consider an inductor. An inductor stores energy in a magnetic field with inductance $L$. The voltage across the inductor is related to the current by
$$
v_L(t) = \omega L I \sin\left(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
$$

![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/4-3.png)

These equations are basically the steady state behavior (think of it as like an equilibrium state) of the circuit.

We will also look at circuits involving combinations of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/4-4.png)

Normally to get the steady state, we will need to use differential equations, but we can use complex numbers to avoid using differential equations. To do this, we will generalize Ohm's Law.

However, before we start, note the following equations:

1. For resistors in series, we have $R = R_1 + R_2$

2. For resistors in parallel, we have $\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$

Now, as a mathematical trick, we introduce a complex current, $\hat i(t) = Ie^{j \omega t}$. With this, the imaginary part of the current is the actual current:
$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{Im}(\hat i(t)) &= \mathrm{Im}(Ie^{j \omega t}) \\
    &= \mathrm{Im}(I (\cos(\omega t) + j \sin(\omega t))) \\
    &= I \sin(\omega t) \\
    &= i(t)
\end{align*}
$$

## Lecture 5 (May 13, 2024)
### Applications to Circuit Analysis Impedance (Continued)
From last lecture, we are given a current $i(t) = I\sin(\omega t)$, and we had the following laws.
- For a resistor, $v_R(t) = IR\sin(\omega t)$ (Ohm's Law).
- For a capacitor, $v_C(t) = \frac{I}{\omega C}\sin(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2})$.
- For an inductor, $v_L(t) = \omega L I \sin(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{2})$.

To find the steady state relationship between $i(t)$ and $v(t)$ in a circuit with multiple such components, we introduce a complex current $\hat i(t) = I e^{j\omega t}$, so
$$
i(t) = \mathrm{Im}(\hat i(t))
$$
and a complex voltage $\hat v(t)$.

What $\hat i(t)$ is doing is that imagine we had a circle on the complex plane with radius $I$. As time progresses, the point on the circle moves around the circle at a rate of $\omega$ radians per second. The projection of this point onto the imaginary axis gives us the actual current $i(t)$, this is why we take the imaginary part of $\hat i(t)$. Turns out that if our current is cosine, then we would take the real part of $\hat i(t)$ to be the actual current. We will demonstrate this in an example later.

Considering the three laws, how can we write them in complex form? We can just replace $\sin \theta$ with $e^{j\theta}$, so we have
- For a resistor, $\hat v_R(t) = I R e^{j\omega t}$.
- For a capacitor, $\hat v_C(t) = \frac{I}{j\omega C} e^{j(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2})} = \frac{I}{j\omega C} e^{j\omega t}e^{-j\frac{\pi}{2}} = -\frac{jI}{\omega C} e^{j\omega t} = \frac{I}{j\omega C} e^{j \omega t}$.
- For an inductor, $\hat v_L(t) = \omega L I e^{j(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{2})} = \omega L I e^{j\omega t} e^{j \frac{\pi}{2}} = j \omega L I e^{j\omega t}$.

So we can write
$$
\hat v = Z i, \quad \text{where } Z = \begin{cases}
    R & \text{for a resistor} \\
    \frac{1}{j\omega C} & \text{for a capacitor} \\
    j\omega L & \text{for an inductor}
\end{cases}
$$
$Z$ is called the **impedance**.
#### Examples
Suppose we are working with a current $i(t) = I \sin t$ (so $\omega = 1$) and it passes through the following circuit:

![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/5-1.png)

We want to find $v(t)$.

We let $\hat i(t) = I e^{jt}$.
- The impedance of the resistor is $Z_R = R = 5$.
- The impedance of the capacitor is $Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C} = \frac{1}{0.1j} = \frac{10}{j} = -10j$.

Since they are connected in series, the total impedance is
$$
Z = Z_R + Z_C = 5 - 10j
$$
Therefore
$$
\hat v = Z \hat i = (5 - 10j)Ie^{jt}
$$
Then to get the actual voltage, there are two ways to proceed: using standard form or exponential form.

Using standard form, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
    \hat v &= I(5 - 10j)(\cos t + j \sin t) \\
    &= I[(5 \cos t + 10 \sin t) + j(5 \sin t - 10 \cos t)]
\end{align*}
$$
and the actual voltage is the imaginary part of $\hat v$, which is
$$
v(t) = \mathrm{Im}(\hat v(t)) = I(5 \sin t - 10 \cos t)
$$

If we use exponential form, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
    \hat v &= I \sqrt{125} e^{-j \tan^{-1}(2)} e^{jt} \\
    &= 5 \sqrt 5 I e^{j(t - \tan^{-1}(2))}
\end{align*}
$$
Then $v(t) = 5 \sqrt 5 I \sin(t - \tan^{-1}(2))$.

Now, suppose we are working with the following circuit:

![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/5-2.png)

with current $i(t) = 2 \cos(5t)$. Find $v(t)$.

We let $\hat i(t) = 2 e^{j5t}$. Since we are using cosine, the actual current is the real part $i(t) = \mathrm{Re}(\hat i(t))$.

We have
- $Z_R = 25$
- $Z_L = j \omega L = j5(10) = 50j$
- $Z_C = \frac{1}{j \omega C} = \frac{1}{0.1j} = \frac{10}{j} = -10j$

For the parallel section, we have
$$
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{Z_{RL}} &= \frac{1}{Z_R} + \frac{1}{Z_L} \\
    &= \frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{50j} \\
    &= \frac{2j + 1}{50j}
\end{align*}
$$
So
$$
\begin{align*}
    Z_{RL} &= \frac{50j}{2j + 1} \frac{1 - 2j}{1 - 2j} \\
    &= \frac{100 + 50j}{5} \\
    &= 20 + 10j
\end{align*}
$$
Finally, we have
$$
Z = Z_{RL} + Z_C = (20 + 10j) - 10j = 20
$$
So
$$
\hat v(t) = Z \hat i = 20 \hat i = 40 e^{j5t}
$$
This implies that $v(t) = 40 \cos(5t)$.
### Sets in the Complex Plane
Let $S$ be a set of points in $\mathbb C$. Then
- A **neighborhood** of a point $z_0$ is 
  $$
  N_\epsilon(z_0) = \{z \in \mathbb C : |z - z_0| < \epsilon\}
  $$
  where $\epsilon \in \mathbb R$.
- A **deleted neighborhood** of a point $z_0$ is
  $$
  DN_\epsilon(z_0) = \{z \in \mathbb C : 0 < |z - z_0| < \epsilon\}
  $$
- A point $z_0$ is an **interior point** to $S$ if there exists a neighborhood of $z_0$ with contains only points in $S$.
- A point $z_0$ is an **exterior point** to $S$ if there exists a neighborhood of $z_0$ which contains no points in $S$.
- A point $z_0$ is a **boundary point** of $S$ if every neighborhood of $z_0$ contains some points in $S$ and some points not in $S$.
- The set of all boundary points of $S$ is called the **boundary** of $S$.
- The set $S$ is **open** if it contains none of its boundary points.
- The set $S$ is **closed** if it contains all its boundary points.
  - Note that if $S$ is open, then its complement is closed, and vice versa.
  - The set $S = \mathbb C$ has no boundary points, so it is both open and closed.
- The **closure** of $S$ is the set of $S$ plus its boundary.
- An open set $S$ is **connected** if any two points within it can be connected by a polygonal path lying entirely within $S$.
- An open, connected set $S$ is called a **domain** (not to be confused with the domain of a function).
- A **region** is a domain plus some, none, or all of its boundary points (so every domain can also be called a region).
## Lecture 6 (May 13, 2024)
### Extended Complex Plane ($\mathbb C \cup \{\infty\}$)
We can define a neighborhood of infinity as
$$
N_\epsilon(\infty) = \{z \in \mathbb C : |z| > \frac{1}{\epsilon}\}
$$
for some $\epsilon \in \mathbb R$. The concept of Riemann Sphere can help.

Consider the $x_1x_2$ plane, with a third axis $x_3$, and a unit sphere centered at the origin. If we draw a line from $(0, 0, 1)$ (the north pole) to a point $(x, y, 0)$ on the plane, the line intersects the sphere at two points, one of which is the north pole, and one on the surface of the sphere. Therefore, we get a one-to-one mapping from the plane to the sphere, except for the north pole.

![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/6-1.jpg)

Here are some key realizations:
- The north pole corresponds to $\infty$ (in every direction).
- The south pole corresponds to $z = 0$.
- The equator corresponds to the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ ($e^{i\theta} = 1$)
- The domain $|z| > 1$ maps to the northern hemisphere.
- The domain $|z| < 1$ maps to the southern hemisphere.
- Circles and lines in the plane all map to circles on the sphere.

### Functions from $\mathbb C$ to $\mathbb C$
Given a mapping $f: \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$, we will write $w = f(z)$. Since both $z$ and $w$ have real and imaginary parts, we can also write
$$
w = f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)
$$
#### Examples
Let $f(z) = z^2$. Find the image of
1. the 1st quadrant.

    We know that squaring a number scales the modulus, and doubles the argument. So the image is the 1st and 2nd quadrant. Observe that in the 1st quadrant, $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$. Then, since
    $$
    w = z^2 = (x + iy)^2 = \underbrace{(x^2 - y^2)}_{u(x, y)} + i \underbrace{2xy}_{v(x, y)}
    $$
    We get that $v \geq 0$ (since $x, y \geq 0$), with no restriction on $u$. Thus, the image is the 1st and 2nd quadrant.

    ![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/6-4.png)
2. the strip $1 \leq \mathrm{Re}(z) \leq 2$.

    For a vertical line $x = x_0$, the image is 
    $$
    w = \underbrace{(x_0^2 - y^2)}_{u(x, y)} + i \underbrace{2x_0 y}_{v(x, y)}
    $$
    Rearranging $v = 2x_0 y$, we get $y = \frac{v}{2x_0}$. Substituting this equation into $u = x_0^2 - y^2$, we get
    $$
    u = x_0^2 - \left(\frac{v}{2x_0}\right)^2
    $$
    These are parabolas, so with $x_0 = 1$, we get $u = 1 - \frac{1}{4} v^2$. With $x_0 = 2$, we get $u = 4 - \frac{1}{16} v^2$.

    ![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/6-5.png)

Another example. What does $f(z) = |z|$ do? It maps the whole plane to the positive real axis. That is, it maps domains to intervals on the positive real axis.

Now, what does $f(z) = z - z_0$ do?

This gives 
$$
\begin{align*}
    w &= (x + iy) - (x_0 + iy_0) \\
    &= (x - x_0) + i(y - y_0)
\end{align*}
$$
which is a translation.

How about the mapping $f(z) = iz + i$? The image of the half-space $\mathrm{Re}(z) \geq 1$ under this mapping is 

![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/6-6.png)

How about $f(z) = \bar z$? This is a reflection across the real axis.

The inverse mapping $f(z) = \frac{1}{z}$ is particularly important. Observe that $w = \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{re^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{r} e^{-i\theta}$. That is, if $|z| = r$ and $\text{Arg}(z) = \theta$, then $|w| = \frac{1}{r}$ and $\text{Arg}(w) = -\theta$. 

What is the image of the circle $|z - 1| = 1$ under $f(z) = \frac{1}{z}$?

We can convert to polar form:
$$
\begin{align*}
    |z - 1| &= 1 \\
    (x - 1)^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\
    x^2 + y^2 = 2x \\
    r^2 = 2r \cos \theta
\end{align*}
$$
Then, under the mapping, we replace $r$ with $\frac{1}{r}$ and $\theta$ with $-\theta$. So we get $r = 2 \cos \theta$, $x = \frac{1}{2}$, which is a vertical line.

## Lecture 7 (May 15, 2024)
Here are some more examples.

Find the image of the upper half of the unit circle under the mapping $w = \frac{z}{z + 1}$. A trick to this question is that we can rewrite $w$ as 
$$
w = \frac{z + 1 - 1}{z + 1} = 1 - \frac{1}{z + 1}
$$
Now we can interpret this as a sequence of simpler transformations.
- $z + 1$ shifts the unit circle to the right by 1 unit.
- $\frac{1}{z + 1}$ inverts the circle, which becomes a non-positive vertical line with $x$-intercept at $\frac{1}{2}$.

    ![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/7-1.png)
- $- \frac{1}{z + 1}$ negates both the real and imaginary parts, so the line becomes a non-negative vertical line with $x$-intercept at $-\frac{1}{2}$.
  
    ![](/images/school/spring-2024/pmath332/7-2.png)
- $1 - \frac{1}{z + 1}$ shifts the line to the right by 1 unit, so the image is a non-negative vertical line with $x$-intercept at $\frac{1}{2}$.

### Limits and Continuity
We define limits and continuity the same way as in single-variable calculus, except how we treat our new point at infinity, and how absolute values are now replaced with moduli.
#### Definitions
- $\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = w_0$ means that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
    $$
    0 < |z - z_0| < \delta \implies |f(z) - w_0| < \epsilon
    $$
- $\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = \infty$ means that for any $M > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
    $$
    0 < |z - z_0| < \delta \implies |f(z)| > \frac{1}{\epsilon}
    $$
- $\lim_{z \to \infty}f(z) = w_0$ means that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
    $$
    |z| > \frac{1}{\delta} \implies |f(z) - w_0| < \epsilon
    $$
- $\lim_{z \to \infty} f(z) = \infty$ means that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
    $$
    |z| > \frac{1}{\delta} \implies |f(z)| > \frac{1}{\epsilon}
    $$
- A function $f(z)$ is continuous at $z_0$ if
    $$
    \lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = f(z_0)
    $$

And based on the definitions above, we have the following theorems.
#### Theorems
- $\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = \infty$ if and only if $\lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{1}{f(z)} = 0$.
- $\lim_{z \to \infty} f(z) = w_0$ if and only if $\lim_{z \to 0} f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) = w_0$.
- $\lim_{z \to \infty} f(z) = \infty$ if and only if $\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{1}{f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)} = 0$.
- Let $f(z) = u + iv$, and let $z = x_0 + iy_0$ and let $w_0 = u_0 + iv_0$. Then $\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = w_0$ if and only if
    $$
    \lim_{(x, y) \to (x_0, y_0)} u(x, y) = u_0
    $$
    and
    $$
    \lim_{(x, y) \to (x_0, y_0)} v(x, y) = v_0
    $$
### Differentiation
We have the formal definition of the derivative as
<Definition>
    <DefinitionName>Derivative</DefinitionName>
    <DefinitionContent>
        Let $f: \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$ and let $z_0 \in \mathbb C$. The derivative of $f$ at $z_0$ is
        $$
        f'(z_0) = \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0}
        $$
        We can also let $\Delta z = z - z_0$, and write
        $$
        f'(z_0) = \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z_0 + \Delta z) - f(z_0)}{\Delta z}
        $$
        and hence define the derivative as a function
        $$
        f'(z) = \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z + \Delta z) - f(z)}{\Delta z}
        $$
    </DefinitionContent>
</Definition>
For functions with analogues in $\mathbb R$, the familiar rules apply (Product, Quotient, Power, Chain Rule).

What about functions without real analogues? For example, is $f(z) = \bar z$ differentiable? Let $z_0$ be arbitrary. Then
$$
\begin{align*}
    f'(z_0) &= \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0} \\
    &= \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{\bar z - \bar{z_0}}{z - z_0} \\
    &= \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{\overline{z - z_0}}{z - z_0}
\end{align*}
$$
then we can write $z - z_0$ as $re^{i\theta}$, where $r = |z - z_0|$ and $\theta = \arg(z - z_0)$, then
$$
\begin{align*}
    f'(z_0) &= \lim_{z \to z_0} \frac{re^{-i\theta}}{re^{i\theta}} \\
    &= \lim_{z \to z_0} e^{-2i\theta}
\end{align*}
$$
Therefore the value of the limit depends on the angle of approach. If we approach along the real axis (i.e. $\theta = 0$ or $\theta = \pi$), then $e^{-2i\theta} = 1$. If we approach along the imaginary axis (i.e. $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ or $\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}$), then $e^{-2i\theta} = -1$. Since the value $e^{-2i\theta}$ depends on the angle of approach, the limit does not exist, and so $f(z) = \bar z$ is not differentiable.

Why should such a well-behaved function not be differentiable? Consider this. We can view $f(z)$ as a mapping from $(x, y)$ to $(u, v)$ since
$$
f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) 
$$
This suggests that we have four partial derivatives involved:
- $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = u_x$
- $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = u_y$
- $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = v_x$
- $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = v_y$

However, we have defined $f'(z)$ to be a complex number, so it only has **two** components. This means that if $f'(z)$ exists then $u_x,u_y,v_x,v_y$ must be related, and there can only be two independent quantities among them.
### Cauchy-Riemann Equations
<Theorem withName={true}>
    <TheoremName>Cauchy-Riemann Equations</TheoremName>
    <TheoremContent>
        Let $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ and suppose that $f'(z_0)$ exists. Then at $(x_0,y_0)$ we have $u_x = v_y$ and $v_x = -u_y$.
    </TheoremContent>
</Theorem>
<Proof>
    <ProofContent>
        We have
        $$
        \begin{align*}
            f(z_0) &= \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z_0 + \Delta z) - f(z_0)}{\Delta z} \\
            &= \lim_{(\Delta x, \Delta y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{u(x_0 + \Delta x, y_0 + \Delta y) - u(x_0, y_0)}{\Delta x + i\Delta y} \\
            &\quad + i \lim_{(\Delta x, \Delta y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{v(x_0 + \Delta x, y_0 + \Delta y) - v(x_0, y_0)}{\Delta x + i\Delta y}
        \end{align*}
        $$
        Since the derivative exists by assumption, its limit must exist as well, so its value is independent of the path of approach. Approaching along $\Delta y = 0$, we find
        $$
        \begin{align*}
            f'(z_0) &= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{u(x_0 + \Delta x, y_0) - u(x_0, y_0)}{\Delta x} \\
            &\quad + i \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{v(x_0 + \Delta x, y_0) - v(x_0, y_0)}{\Delta x} \\
            &= u_x + iv_x
        \end{align*}
        $$
        If we approach along $\Delta x = 0$ instead, we get
        $$
        \begin{align*}
            f'(z_0) &= \frac{1}{i} (u_y + iv_y) \\
            &= v_y - iu_y
        \end{align*}
        $$
        Now, since $f'(z_0)$ should be the same for both paths, we must have
        $$
        u_x = v_y \quad \text{and} \quad v_x = -u_y
        $$
    </ProofContent>
</Proof>
## Lecture 8 (May 17, 2024)
### Example
Let's give some examples of the Cauchy-Riemann Equations. Is the function $f(z) = |z|^2$ differentiable anywhere?

We have
$$
f(z) = |x + iy|^2 = x^2 + y^2
$$
Thus we have $u(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ and $v(x,y) = 0$. Hence the partial derivatives are
- $u_x = 2x$
- $u_y = 2y$
- $v_x = 0$
- $v_y = 0$

Then the Cauchy-Riemann Equations require that
- $u_x = v_y$ gives $2x = 0$ which implies $x = 0$
- $v_x = -u_y$ gives $0 = -2y$ which implies $y = 0$

Therefore, $f(z)$ cannot be differentiable unless $x = y = 0$. So we check whether $f'(0)$ exists. We have
$$
\begin{align*}
    f'(0) &= \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(0 + \Delta z) - f(0)}{\Delta z} \\
    &= \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{|\Delta z|^2}{\Delta z} \\
    &= 0
\end{align*}
$$
why is it 0? We have two ways:
- By Squeeze Theorem, we have $\left| \frac{|\Delta z|^2}{\Delta z} \right| = |\Delta z| \to 0$.
- Recall the equation $|z|^2 = z \bar z$, so we have $\frac{|\Delta z|^2}{\Delta z} = \frac{\Delta z \bar{\Delta z}}{\Delta z} = \bar{\Delta z} \to 0$.

So $f'(0) = 0$.

Let's explain what we did for Squeeze Theorem. Here is the definition of the Squeeze Theorem.
<Theorem withName={true}>
    <TheoremName>Squeeze Theorem</TheoremName>
    <TheoremContent>
        Let $f(z), g(z), h(z)$ be functions such that $f(z) \leq g(z) \leq h(z)$ for all $z$ in some neighborhood of $z_0$, and suppose that
        $$
        \lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = \lim_{z \to z_0} h(z) = L
        $$
        Then
        $$
        \lim_{z \to z_0} g(z) = L
        $$
    </TheoremContent>
</Theorem>
For our example above, we let $\Delta z = x + iy$, then $|\Delta z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, and thus our equation is
$$
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{|\Delta z|^2}{\Delta z} &= \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + iy}
\end{align*}
$$
Then let's find the upper bound and lower bound of the modulus of our expression $\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + iy}$, so we have 
$$
\begin{align*}
    \left| \frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + iy} \right| &= \frac{|x^2 + y^2|}{|x + iy|} \\
    &= \frac{x^2 + y^2}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\
    &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = |\Delta z|
\end{align*}
$$
That is,
$$
\left| \frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + iy} \right| = |\Delta z|
$$
So, we have
$$
- |\Delta z| \leq \frac{x^2 + y^2}{x + iy} \leq |\Delta z|
$$
both bounds approach 0 as $\Delta z \to 0$, so by the Squeeze Theorem, the limit is 0.
