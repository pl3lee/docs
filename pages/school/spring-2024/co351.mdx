### Graphs
Let's start with basic definitions of graphs.
<Definition name="Graph">
A graph $G$ is a pair $(V, E)$ where $V$ is a finite set and $E$ is a set of unordered pairs of distinct elements of $V$.
</Definition>
<Definition name="Adjacent, Endpoints, and Incident">
Consider the edge $ij$. Then 
- $i$ and $j$ are adjacent vertices
- $i$ and $j$ are the endpoints of the edge
- Edge $ij$ is said to be incident to vertices $i$ and $j$
</Definition>
<Definition name="Degree">
The degree of a vertex $v$ is the number of edges incident to $v$. We use the notation $d_G(v)$ or $d(v)$ to denote the degree of $v$ in graph $G$.
</Definition>
<Definition name="Walk">
A walk $Q$ is a non-empty sequence of edges. For example, $v_1v_2,v_2v_3,\ldots,v_{k-1}v_k$. We can abbreviate this by only writing the vertices: $v_1v_2\ldots v_k$.

Note that an edge may appear several times in a walk.
</Definition>
<Definition name="Path">
A path $P$ is a walk such that $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ are distinct vertices, meaning that we visit a new node at each step.
</Definition>
<Definition name="Cycle">
A cycle $C = v_1,\ldots,v_k$ is a walk such that $k \geq 3$ and $v_1 = v_k$ with $v_1,\ldots,v_{k-1}$ being distinct.
</Definition>
<Definition name="st-walk">
An $st$-walk is a walk that starts at $s$ and ends at $t$.
</Definition>
<Definition name="st-path">
An $st$-path is a path that starts at $s$ and ends at $t$, with $s \neq t$.
</Definition>
<Definition name="Cut">
For a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$, the cut with shore $S$ is the set of edges with exactly one endpoint in $S$. We use the notation
$$
\delta(S) = \{ij \in E : i \in S, j \notin S\}
$$
</Definition>
<Definition name="st-Cut">
For vertices $s$ and $t$ with $s \neq t$ of $G$, and $st$-cut of $G$ is a cut $\delta(S)$ where $S \subset V$, with $s \in S$ and $t \notin S$.
</Definition>
Now, we have our first theorem.
<Theorem>
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, and let $s, t$ be vertices of $G$. Then there exists an $st$-path if and only if every $st$-cut is non-empty.
</Theorem>
<Proof>
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that there exists an $st$-path $P = v_1,\ldots,v_k$ where $s = v_1$, and $t = v_k$. We prove that every $st$-cut is non-empty. Let $\delta(\hat S)$ be any $st$-cut, where $s \in \hat S$ and $t \notin \hat S$. Let $\ell$ be the largest index such that $v_\ell \in \hat S$, and note that $\ell \neq k$ since $v_k = t$ is not in $\hat S$. So, we have that $v_{\ell + 1}$ is not in $\hat S$. Thus, the edge $v_\ell v_{\ell + 1}$ is in $\delta(\hat S)$, hence $\delta(\hat S) \neq \emptyset$. GRAPH NEEDED TO BE ADDED HERE.
</Proof>
