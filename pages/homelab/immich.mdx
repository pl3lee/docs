## Using immich-go to upload files to Immich
1. First download the immich-go binary from the releases page [here](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go)
2. Move the binary to a directory where you are placing your files to upload. So, suppose that you have a directory called `photos` and inside there are subdirectories, representing the albums, then you can move the binary to the same level as the `photos` directory.
3. Run the binary with the following command:

If you are uploading the whole `photos` directory: 
```bash
./immich-go -server http://192.168.50.48:9090 -key <API key of user> upload -create-album-folder=true photos
```
This creates an album for each subdirectory in the `photos` directory.

If you are uploading from a Google takeout (you do not need to unzip the takeout file):
```bash
./immich-go -server http://192.168.50.48:9090 -key <API key of user> upload -google-photos <path to the takeout file>
```
